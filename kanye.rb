this vacation's useless
these white pills aren't kind
i've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive

i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights

i've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
the days have come and gone
our lives went by so fast

i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
where i laid and told you but you swear you loved me more
