# There Is - Boxcar Racer
puts"this vacation's useless
	these white pills aren't kind
	i've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
	i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
	and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
	i've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
	the days have come and gone
	our lives went by so fast
	i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
	where i laid and told you but you swear you loved me more"
